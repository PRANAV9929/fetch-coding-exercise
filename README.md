# fetch-coding-exercise
Hello,
I worked on data using Python & Pandas data frame in Google Colab.
For setting up the database and solving the queries, I have used SQL workbench.
The solutions and the ER diagram are in the 'solutions-with-ERdiagaram.pdf' file.
The cleaned data files for the three given data files are brands_cleaned.csv, users_cleaned.csv, receipts_cleaned.csv.
Python notebook is also attached as a reference for the coding done. It is in the file - 'python-notebook.html'.
'Queries.sql' and 'tablecreation.sql' are attached for the reference of the queries performed as part of the second question in the exercise.
